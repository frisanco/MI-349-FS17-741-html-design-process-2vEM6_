            <p> The history of our world is special, but there is an entire universe to explore,
                with planets, creatures, and histories beyond earth. </p>

            <h3><strong> Long Pitch </strong></h3>
            <p> Mankind was made to explore, not only our world but everything around us.
                Earth Beyond was created to establish a willingness for adventure, exploration, and discovery
                into the farthest reaches of our universe. This exploration, however, is not one that only
                a single person can accomplish. This will require hardwork, dedication, and most importantly
                strong leaders and teamwork. Think you've got what it takes to look beyond our skies, to boldly
                go where no one has gone before? If so, welcome! Adventure is calling, and the sky is never the limit! </p>
